## Solution:
The error message clearly states that Kubernetes is unable to provision the load balancer because multiple security groups are tagged for the EC2 instance hosting the Kubernetes node. The load balancer requires a single, properly configured security group to function correctly.

---

### Issue Details:
The instance `i-0bfe279b164a0dc98` is associated with **two tagged security groups**:
1. `sg-099025499b7126c62` (eks-cluster-sg)
2. `sg-059a9ad2943caad81` (node security group)

This is causing a conflict because Kubernetes expects only the **EKS cluster security group** to be tagged for the instance to configure the load balancer correctly.

---

### Resolution Steps:

#### 1. Identify the Correct Security Group
- The security group required for the load balancer is usually the one associated with the **EKS cluster**. In your case:
  - Likely correct: `sg-099025499b7126c62` (eks-cluster-sg).

#### 2. Modify the Security Groups for the Node
You need to ensure only the correct security group (e.g., `eks-cluster-sg`) is tagged for the EC2 instance.

1. **Log in to the AWS Management Console:**
   - Navigate to the **EC2 Dashboard**.
   - Locate the instance with ID `i-0bfe279b164a0dc98`.

2. **Update the Security Groups:**
   - Remove the incorrect security group (`sg-059a9ad2943caad81`).
   - Ensure only the correct security group (`sg-099025499b7126c62`) is attached to the instance.

3. **Reapply Tags if Needed:**
   - Ensure the correct security group has the required Kubernetes tags. Typically:
     - `kubernetes.io/cluster/<cluster-name>: owned`
     - Any additional tags specific to your setup.

#### 3. Verify IAM Policies
Ensure the IAM role attached to your worker nodes allows modifying security groups and provisioning load balancers.

#### 4. Retry the Service
After making the above changes, Kubernetes should be able to provision the load balancer. Check the service status:
```bash
kubectl get service nop-svc -o wide
```

#### 5. Monitor Events
If issues persist, check the events again:
```bash
kubectl describe service nop-svc
```

---

### Preventive Measures:
1. **Review Security Group Assignments:**
   - During cluster setup, ensure only the required security groups are attached to the nodes.

2. **Automate Security Group Tagging:**
   - Use Terraform or AWS CLI scripts to manage security groups consistently during cluster creation.

3. **Review AWS Load Balancer Controller:**
   - If you're using the AWS Load Balancer Controller, ensure it is correctly installed and configured with appropriate IAM permissions.
